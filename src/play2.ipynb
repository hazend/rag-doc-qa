      "Based on the context provided, both HDFC Life Sampoorn Nivesh Plus and HDFC Life Smart Protect Plan are linked insurance products offered by HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited, and they carry investment risks associated with capital markets as the Unit Prices may go up or down based on the performance of the Funds and factors influencing the market. However, the names of these products do not indicate their quality, future prospects, or returns. For someone looking to minimize risk and invest monthly with a low-aggressive portfolio, it is unclear which product would be more suitable as the context does not provide enough information to make a direct comparison between the two. It is recommended to further research and consult with a financial advisor for guidance on which product would be more appropriate based on individual circumstances and investment goals. If the context does not provide enough information to answer the question, the answer would be \"I don't know.\"\n",
