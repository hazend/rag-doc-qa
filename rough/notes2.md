For someone looking to minimize risk and invest monthly with a low-aggressive portfolio, it is unclear which product would be more suitable as the context does not provide enough information to make a direct comparison between the two. It is recommended to further research and consult with a financial advisor for guidance on which product would be more appropriate based on individual circumstances and investment goals. If the context does not provide enough information to answer the question, the answer would be "I don't know."
